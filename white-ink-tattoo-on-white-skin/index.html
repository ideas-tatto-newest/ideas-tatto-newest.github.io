<p>White ink goes very well with highlighting parts of a larger tattoo design, but an all white ink tattoo is a bit of a gamble. Many people who get these tattoos get them for this very reason. This, like any other ink, distorts the color due to the natural tone of the skin, making it adopt another hue rather than white. After all, your skin is the initial canvas for the tattoo, providing the backdrop for the entire piece. And as paler you are, more the white tatto ink will look as white as possible, those reaching the desirable white tattoo effect.</p>
