<p>Firstly, some believe that just as the stars appear at night, the star tattoo shows the fight against the darkness. Firstly, some believe that just as the stars appear at night, the star tattoo shows the fight against the darkness. That doesn�t however mean that all star/pentagram tattoo�s have religious meaning. If someone has a nautical star tattoo on the left wrist, aligned with his thumb, for instance, the star acts as a positive guide for the future. Surely, by making the decision to get a star tattoo, it is also worth taking the time and coming up with a design that is unique to you.</p>

<p>From big stars, to night skies, to tiny little strings of stars fluttering down the wrist, there is a star tattoo out there for everyone. A tattoo meaning may be archetypal or it may be personal. It’s usually because the area looks a little badass, but they are also about keeping it to yourself. A nautical star tattoo can mean staying on course, finding your way, and an eternal connection to something or someone that you find ‘guides’ you through life. By the end of this post, we hope you feel more informed about the star tattoo.</p>
