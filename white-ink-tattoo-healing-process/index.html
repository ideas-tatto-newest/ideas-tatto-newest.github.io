<p>Like i said above, you�re likely to get itchy, scabby skin during the healing process. Starting from the basic restoration, the proper tending, and the extent of tattoo healing, you should equip yourself with the proper knowledge on the healing process. Whatever you do, resist the urge to pick or peel, as it can really mess up the color and lines of your tattoo. The wound must also protect itself from outside bacteria and this regeneration is what it will have to go through until it heals completely. This also applies to scabbing.</p>
