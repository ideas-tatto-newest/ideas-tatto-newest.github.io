In the months since unus annus was created, the pair has posted a new video each day. Memento mori may mean “remember that you will die,” but it also means that because of that fact, you must remember to live.</p>

<p>With numerous fan videos &amp; fan art available online, it’s hard to believe every video reference to unus annus will be deleted, but the majority of fans are ready to honor the meaning of unus annus and take down their content after the channel is deleted. But a slave would be behind him saying memento mori. Written by admintaa november 13, 2020. A series in which markiplier and ethan from crankgameplays embark on a year long journey, only for it to be completely deleted in a year. An excuse for mark to display his masochism</p>
