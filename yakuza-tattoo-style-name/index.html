<p>At this point, the yakuza have become permanently incorporated into the cultural lexicon: Akira nishikiyama (錦山 彰, nishikiyama akira), often referred to as nishiki, is a major supporting character in yakuza 0 andthe main antagonist of the first yakuza/yakuza kiwami. For the yakuza, it was a good thing to be an outlaw, and they openly declared this through the name they gave themselves: The designs within the tattoo will vary and you will see koi fish, tigers and snakes in yakuza tattoos.
