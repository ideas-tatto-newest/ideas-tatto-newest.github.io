<p>Forearm tattoo bts jungkook reveals his forearm tattoo in a scene from on Que ce soit un tatouage permanent ou pas, cela reste un mystère, et un fan du bts en a récemment fait une analyse descriptive. Jungkook wanted to get a tattoo when he was 17, but suga talked to him about it and changed his. This tattoo is the army logo. According to fans, the flower is supposedly associated with the phrase.</p>

<p>Personally i think tattoos suits him well. He recently got the word “army” tattooed on the knuckles of his right hand, along with several other meaningful symbols surrounding the letters. Army discovered that jungkook carries a very special flower on his right arm. Jungkook’s new thumb tattoo is the sweetest bts army tribute we’ve ever seen. The new arm tattoo has only been caught in teasing glimpses until bts released their “on” music video, where the flower and letters alongside it were seen with more clarity.</p>

<p>Unknown this tattoo on his arm is still unknown. According to fans, this tattoo represents jungkook’s birth flower, the tiger lily. “jimin�s ₁₃ wrist tattoo means both bangtan’s debut date and his birthday, his tattoo�s really holds a deep meaning to him,” an army noted after seeing the tat. While jungkook isn�t too open about his tattoos, fans have been able to catch glimpses of them through screen shots and closeups. There are also suggestions that it is a tiger flower that represents sept.</p>
