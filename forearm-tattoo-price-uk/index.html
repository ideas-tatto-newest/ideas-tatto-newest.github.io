<p>I know that everywhere is different and it depends on the size, colours and shading but im looking to get my fore arm tattoo�d not too but with a pocket watch with a feather sweeping around it and a skull at the bottom, it sounds big but in my head it is about 4 inches tall and 3 inches wide. I�ve known lots of my friends going to �cheap� tattooists and ending up with something they hate which they�ve then gone onto have covered up. Looking at different parts of europe, tattoo artists and shops in paris or amsterdam charge roughly us$200/hour. See more ideas about cross tattoo designs, cross tattoo, tattoo designs. This is just to give a general idea as the cost can vary.</p>
