<p>The tattoo �army� resembles two meanings, and you people might already know the first meaning of the tat. Don�t panic, but jimin may have a nevermind tattoo. He got it at the tattoo shop in geoje island. At first i was a bit skeptical of how real the tattoo was. If you feel the urge to educate me on the history of jimin�s fake nevermind tattoo, let me stop you, because what i�m saying.</p>

<p>It’s been more than half a year since we first saw the tattoo, and jimin hasn’t mentioned it once. These dates could be a glimpse of what the idol most appreciates. At first i was a bit skeptical of how real the tattoo was. The bangtan boys just won’t stop showing off their ink—whether it’s fake or real. The meaning behind jimin’s tattoo and more fun bts facts.</p>

<p>If im not mistaken, it refers to a bts song entitled “nevermind.” the song is about all the struggles they encountered especially in their earlier days. Jimin recently did a vlive , where fans noticed a new tattoo on his wrist , which left them very intrigued, shocked and excited to know its meaning, it is not the first time that the idol gives hints that he loves to express himself through your skin. 7 on february 21, bts held a live broadcast for fans to discuss the meaning behind their latest project. If you feel the urge to educate me on the history of jimin�s fake nevermind tattoo, let me stop you, because what i�m saying. She has well over 20 tattoos!.</p>
