Tattoo pigment is the main culprit for triggering an allergic reaction. Red tattoo ink, because some red inks are made with mercury or cinnabar, is the cause of most allergic reactions from tattoo ink, according to a study published in a 2009 issue of journal of cosmetic dermatology.</p>

<p>If you have never been tattooed before or are trying a new ink, it is best to check if you are allergic to the ink before your tattoo is started. Blue is made from cobalt while yellow is made from cadmium. In some cases a novice tattoo artist may not deposit enough ink, or go deep enough. The ink in the tattoo pigments stays in the skin cells of the tattoo and does not spread into the bloodstream or move to other parts of the body. Such is the case when skin rejects tattoo ink, usually with an itchy, red rash in the tattooed area.</p>

<p>Food and drug administration (fda), so you may not always know exactly what’s in your ink. But the fda does compile reports of people’s negative. It�s highly available, inexpensive, and just plain gets the job done. The table below lists some agents that have been used. Never pick the scabs of your tattoo.</p>

<p>When you get new ink, you may be wondering what happens after you get a tattoo and what are some of the gross things to expect. One is allergic contact dermatitis and the other is photoallergic dermatitis 2.the reactions can appear as an inflamed red rash, and the skin can sometimes become scaly and flaky. He says that the only elevated risk in a tattoo causing skin cancer occurs when the tattoo covers up a mole, making changes at that skin location difficult to see. Another thing many people do not realize is that when there is a moderate to severe allergy to the ink, the skin will automatically reject the ink, resulting in a lack of color on the tattoo. Most people notice the fading with red or white ink, although any color may fade.</p>
