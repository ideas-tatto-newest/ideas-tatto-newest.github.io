It will look like a nice clean tattoo line and then there will be a little area where the ink has spread into a not so nice clean line. Having sensitive skin may cause discomfort and minimize the chance of trying out different skin products as well as getting a tattoo.</p>

<p>I had a tattoo done two days ago and the ink was bleeding out as soon as the tattoo was finished. I have a lot of ink, and one of my tattoos bled on the inside of my arm. When it’s likely to appear: My tattoo is weeping fluid out of the bandage. Its a black celtic design on my wrist but since then, the ink appears to have bled out under the skin quite significantly.</p>

<p>This can cause a tattoo deformity called a tattoo blowout, which leads to a tattoo’s ink dispersing below just the very top layers of skin that should be tattooed. Barth explains the tattoo itself may be raised for a couple of days, but if the area surrounding the ink is also puffy and lasts for multiple days after getting the tattoo, it could be. The acute complications of tattooing include pain, slight bleeding, inflammation of the surrounding skin during the procedure, transient hematoma, transiently palpable regional lymph nodes, contact dermatitis to various ointments, and pyogenic infections. It occurs because of a few different things. The top two layers of skin, the epidermis and dermis are where the ink is deposited.</p>
