<p>If you are not up to putting a tattoo on the front then you can have your zelda triforce inked at your lower back. However, for those who have been longtime fans of the franchise, the triforce means a lot and it represents balance and a few vital virtues that people should have. This zelda tattoo is done on the leg, meaning the pain level should below. It is made up of three smaller triangles known as the triforce of wisdom, triforce of power and triforce of courage. Gothic wit can be enshrined by designs stemming from twilight princess, and majora’s mask supplies a bevy of disguises for a sly digital masquerade.</p>

<p>The triforce, easily separated into three segments, can be used as a friendship tattoo between three, or even two, people. The triangular klan symbol bears a certain resemblance to the triforce symbol that appears in the popular legend of zelda video games, with which it should not be confused. Triforce tattoo has an interesting and deeper meaning. The design of the tattoo incorporates the famous zelda sword, as well as the triforce triangle. It is a symbol of an ancient goddess as well as the royal line that reigns throughout the game series.</p>
