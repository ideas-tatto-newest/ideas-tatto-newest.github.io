<p>The last tattoo jimin has that we know about is the “13” inked into his left wrist. The bts member has debuted a new tattoo that fans noticed during a vlive chat on thursday (march 26). Tattoos on his right hand represent himself and he has his own hand tattoo gif on instagram. Fans even came up with a possible meaning behind bts� jimin�s 13 tattoo and it�s so deep. Jimin hasn’t confirmed the news himself, so it’s unclear if the tattoo is real or not.</p>

<p>Still, given that jimin hasn’t confirmed or denied the tat, there’s also suspicion that his new “nevermind” tattoo is also temporary. A post shared by bts jimin 지민 (@jimin) on mar 13, 2020 at 2:36am pdt we love seeing celebs’ new ink, and we love finding out the special meaning behind them even more. Jungkook wanted to get a tattoo when he was 17, but suga talked to him about it and changed his. While jimin was nonchalantly chatting (complete with a bathroom break), armys noticed what looks like a new tattoo on the inside of his left wrist. Recently, the army was surprised by bts jimin‘s new tattoo.</p>
