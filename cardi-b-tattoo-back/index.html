<p>This weekend, rapper cardi b vacationed in turks and caicos with her family, including husband offset ryn. The migos rapper, who wed cardi b in 2017, already had a tattoo of his wife’s name on his neck — right underneath his buttercup tattoo from the powderpuff girls — that he reportedly got in 2018. It required more than 60 hours of work to complete. Cardi b has revealed her latest tattoo, a colorful explosion of flowers that begins at the top of her back and ends on her thigh. The judge hears word from cardi b’s side that the neck tattoo was removed, that the arm was repositioned, that the image was tilted, and so forth, but the judge believes that the jury could find that the changes were insufficiently creative.</p>
