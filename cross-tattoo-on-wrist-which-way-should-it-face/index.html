If you want it facing �properly�, the top end of the cross should be at your wrist and the bottom pointing towards your elbow. Of course some look better one way or another, but if you�re adament that it looks better in an unconventional orientation, then who cares.</p>

<p>This question never really crossed my mine until i saw a girl and she had her writing facing out. Some others might even include the cross tattoo design within another bigger tattoo design. The placement of the tattoo is as important, if not more so. The process has its dangers because it involves needles that can cause numerous infections. You�ve also got to consider the artist having to tattoo it up side down if you have it facing you.</p>

<p>Yes, some ink is placed in a weird way and it does look bad. It urks me a little to see people write too bad your tattoo is facing the wrong way or something along those lines on this thread. You can also add name to your tattoo to make it more beautiful and you can try some of meaningful quotes with cross design. When considering your cross wrist tattoo design, you can easily create a simple and minimalist piece, or opt for a more detailed tattoo like an ornamental cross bracelet. Like, should the writing be facing me or the person opposite of me.</p>

<p>At the very least you�ll want at least a few days of ease on the area right after getting it done. Also the �upside down� cross originally referred to st. I already know for sure that i want to get it but i don�t know which way it should face. Placement options for a cross tattoo. You should get your tattoo in the orientation that looks best to you.</p>
