The white ink stands out better, and can really pop if done by a good tattoo artist due to the huge difference in contrast between the dark skin pigment and the white pigments stored within the ink. These flowers looks very adorable and white ink is fully absorbed by the skin.</p>

<p>Skin as it can affect the natural pigment of the skin. Fake tans affect the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. If you tan, your tattoo tans. Discover (and save!) your own pins on pinterest Just imagine that you look at a white paper using dark sunglasses.</p>

<p>They blur and look weird very quickly. The white ink is just striking with this tattoo. White ink is easily absorbed by your body so it will fade faster than most other colors.(again speaking from experience) Sweet and simple white ink tattoo on a tanned skin tone. This can be a sign of your skin actually rejecting the white ink, and you may end up with no tattoo in that area at all.</p>
