The skin in the eye area is very thin and swells up with pretty much any manipulation (i mean, i get puffy eye bags from a strong gust of wind), so it�s safe to assume that permanent eyeliner can. Apply vaseline ointment to the treated area using a cotton bud.</p>

<p>Here are 5 tips for tattoo aftercare: Permanent eyeliner healing schedule day 1 your freshly done eyeliner is too dark and that can make you regret the decision to have the treatment. Allow it to flake off by itself. Every 2 hours for the first 24 hours after treatment, wipe your eyebrows with cooled boiled water on a cotton wool pad then pat them dry with a clean tissue. If eyeliner procedure is done, a new container of mascara is a must to prevent infection.</p>

<p>Please drink through a straw or carefully with mouth open until fully healed and be careful while brushing teeth. If eyeliner procedure is done, a new container of mascara is a must to prevent infection. And more than ever, they are looking for natural alternatives that can safely heal and preserve their art. The quality of your procedure is dependent on you giving the proper care during the healing process from this point on. I’d already done botox in my masseters, ipl on my broken capillaries and microblading my brows, so this just seemed like the next step in my painful human guinea pig adventures!.</p>
