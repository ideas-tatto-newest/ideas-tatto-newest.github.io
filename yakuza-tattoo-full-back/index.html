<p>The yakuza tattoo is worn by members of the gang as a mark of identity that shows their allegiance to a particular group. She walks by his side and knows everything. Her role is to look after the young recruits and advise the boss. But an irezumi is not bounded to be just a yakuza tattoo, it is the trace of a complicated japanese tradition that has been a component of the nation’s antiquity for a remarkable 12,000 years. The back is the largest area on the body that can get tattooed, they are perfect for a design in mind that you want very big or something with a lot of detail, although not all back tattoos are full pieces, as some choose to get one or more small tattoo on their back, this way there is plenty more room for future tattoos.</p>
