<p>Jungkook has at least 18 known tattoos: The boys of bts know how to express themselves through music, art, and fashion. Fans have been theorizing about the possible meaning of the ink, and some popular theories are that jimin’s favorite number is 13, he was born on october 13, and bts debuted on june 13, 2013. True armys know that it’s been years since jimin first. After several photos of bts’s jimin with his tattoo, the army assures that it has great meaning.</p>
