<p>Star tattoo designs are extremely versatile and are often incorporated into larger designs as a color offset or fill image. Unlike a back of neck tattoo, the front is almost always on display, front and center. Certain star and star patters (constellations) hold significance to astronomers, astrologers, navigators, and star gazers. Stars, when replicated as tattoo designs, can be expressed into various types of designs, and to utter surprise, each of them looks classic and quite aesthetic too. From big stars, to night skies, to tiny little strings of stars fluttering down the wrist, there is a star tattoo out there for everyone.</p>
