<p>Park jimin is a great lover of tattoos, the idol of the company big hit entertainment already has several symbols in different parts of the body and this drives his fans crazy who think that tattoos give a special touch to his anatomy. Jimin is one of two bts members who is known to have tattoos.the other member is jungkook, who went from having no tattoos to 10+ in one summer. It could refer to jimin’s favorite number, his birthday (october 13, 1995), or bts’ first performance as a group (june 13, 2013). There are 111 jimin tattoo for sale on etsy, and they cost $13.38 on average. Suga wanted a tattoo before but his mind changed.</p>

<p>Jimin hasn’t confirmed the news himself, so it’s unclear if the tattoo is real or not. 13 it is not known if it is real, but it has 2 meanings, it can be a clear expression that he cares a lot about himself, that is, he has a good perception of himself, the 13th could be his day of birth. Jimin hasn’t confirmed the news himself, so it’s unclear if the tattoo is real or not. And it definitely wasn’t a temporary one.

<p>The 13 marks jimin’s second tattoo (that we know of). It could refer to jimin’s favorite number, his birthday (october 13, 1995), or bts’ first performance as a group (june 13, 2013). The 13 marks jimin’s second tattoo (that we know of). While jimin was nonchalantly chatting (complete with a bathroom break), armys noticed what looks like a new tattoo on the inside of his left wrist. Jimin and his boat cap come to our rescue on this gloomy thursday;</p>

<p>Jimin is born on 13 october 1995 and his official name is park jimin. It appears that jimin recently got a “13” tattoo and while fans initially thought it was fake, they are now convinced that it is real. Fans even came up with a possible meaning behind jimin’s 13 tattoo and it’s so deep. The tat is a small and simple “13” done in. Park jimin is a great lover of tattoos, the idol of the company big hit entertainment already has several symbols in different parts of the body and this drives his fans crazy who think that tattoos give a special touch to his anatomy.</p>

<p>Fans already knew that the members were going to change their fashion and hair colors to go along with their new concept, but nothing could have prepared them for jimin’s big change in appearance. With the ever popular rain as his idol, he practised his dance moves, with his goal of following the footsteps of his idol one day. But i guess his new tattoo is the number “13” on his wrist. If it is real, though, jimin would be the only member. Jimin�s 13 tattoo was first seen by fans when bts made their yearly vlive comeback special just hours before dropping their new song and album map of the soul:</p>
