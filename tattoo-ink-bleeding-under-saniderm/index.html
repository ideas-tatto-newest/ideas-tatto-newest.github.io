<p>And, while we�re sure you�re excited to show off your new body art, your friends and family will just have to wait awhile. Which will help prevent infection. As your skin recovers from being poked and prodded, there will be. Having ink ooze out of your tattoo for a couple of days is completely normal and nothing to worry about. Your artist should hopefully have packed the area with as much ink as possible to ensure your tattoo still looks perfect once it has finished healing.</p>

<p>Im tripping out and hope its not messed up i got it like 4 hours ago. I had my saniderm on for 6 days, there was some ink bleeding but when i took it off, the tattoo underneath was great. Many people go to get a tattoo without a lot of information on what a freshly drawn tattoo looks or eve feels like. We were told to leave it on for about 4 days. Just got my first tattoo a few hours ago and i just looked into the mirror and knoticed that it looks smudged and watery under the clear bandge.</p>
