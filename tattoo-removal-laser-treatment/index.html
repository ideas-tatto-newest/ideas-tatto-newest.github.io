<p>Laser treatment is often safer than many other tattoo removal methods, such as excision, dermabrasion, or salabrasion because laser treatment selectively treats the pigment in the tattoo. We wipe off the anaesthetic cream just before starting the treatment. However, many people with tattoos come to regret the ink on their skin and want to get rid of it. You may need to allow up to 2 hours for the anaesthetic to take effect. If the colors are pigmented and the size is large, it may take up to 10 sessions.</p>
