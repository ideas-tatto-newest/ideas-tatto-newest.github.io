<p>In china, the cherry blossom is a symbol of femininity, love and courage. We love how the tree stands on its own apart from the armband. When a tattoo artist creates a tree of life, they usually draw bare branches and roots of the tree as intertwining circles, which helps allude to the theme of cyclical life and progressive. In general, it means that the tree is comparable to a human’s life. An armband tattoo essentially takes the shape of a bracelet.</p>

<p>The cherry blossom tree armband can be found in several cultures, and it is used to symbolize different things. These wizened old trees have long been thought of as sacred, and their image in tattoo art can be quite dramatic. This is largely due to the fact that they make great starter tattoos, and if placed high on the arm, are very discreet. Actually, the tree of life is a metaphor used to describe the relationship between man and nature, and every living creature in the universe. This is evidenced by the array of stories and myths that surround it.</p>
