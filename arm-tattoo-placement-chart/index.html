<p>Let’s say you choose to get a 6 square inch tattoo. For a large tattoo, like a half or full sleeve, prices start at $500 and can go all the way up to $4,000 for. If you plan to get a cool half or full sleeve tattoo, be prepared to spend a decent amount of money. If you think you may want to get a tattoo (or another tattoo) but are hesitant because of the potential pain factor, there’s a tool that can help. The same tattoo may have a different meaning if you place it on your chest versus your forearm, or could have a different impact if placed on your back or your calf.</p>

<p>A small tattoo would be lost on such a large area, maybe even to the point it looks like it�s floating in space. Let’s say you choose to get a 6 square inch tattoo. A tribal inspired chest tattoo design, boldly covering one side arm up until the midsection of the chest. For example, a tattoo with curvature and movement, like a large koi fish, would look most suitable on a large, prominent area of your body, such as the legs, arm, or thighs. Similarly, men would not opt for inner thigh tattoos.</p>

<p>Personally, i think that placement plays a massive role in how good your tattoo is going to look. One anchor basically feels like an itch. This is a classic placement for a tattoo for both women and men everywhere. Similarly, men would not opt for inner thigh tattoos. Michael lin, founder of dr.</p>
