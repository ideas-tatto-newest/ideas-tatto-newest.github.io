<p>If you pick a potted plant, you can even plant it in a flower bed to keep the gift. And while they certainly look stunning on men and women’s skin, these flower tattoos have exploded in popularity over the past few years. So i recently got a tattoo and i really want to get another one right next to it. They have a beautiful fragrance. Lotus flower tattoos are amongst my favorite tattoo designs because of their symbolic meaning.</p>
