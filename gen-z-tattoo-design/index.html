<p>Last week, tiktok user @smoothavacados proposed that members of gen z should get matching tattoos — consisting of a capital z with a horizontal line through it — as a generational symbol of unity and rebellion. Chesnot/getty request reprint &amp; licensing , submit. Lettering styles include tribal, traditional sailor, blackletter, fancy, cursive, script, etc. Gen z is creating aesthetic boards across topics like witch, grunge and love. The z design chose is the wolf�s angel symbol that has long been associated with the nazi party and other white supremacist groups as well as hate groups.</p>
