<p>It all depends on your preference, but it’s true that it doesn’t look the same on every tone. Next day onwards, the healing starts with the top shre. Most people do just fine but some reject it more strongly. Yes it is totally normal. As long as you’re getting the work done in a clean, sterile environment like most shops you don’t have anything to worry about.</p>

<p>The third picture of the tattoo healing stages demonstrates what your tattoo will look like the week or so after you have gotten the tattoo just before it starts to peel. How to use aloe vera. New tattoo out of the sun in the first weeks of the healing. It�s especially important to avoid swimming, whether it�s in a lake, ocean, swimming pool or hot tub. Other than that, i think it�s just still in it�s healing process.</p>

<p>Avoid situations that wear on your new tattoo while healing. Here are some advices to slow down the fading process: Picking off the scabs can cause the color to fade and keeps the tattoo from healing properly. That is because, the top shredded layer of the skin completely goes off through peeling. You�ve never had a tattoo before, and when you first get it, it looks perfect save for blood lines around the linework but then the skin freaks out, doesn�t like how there�s an impostor and tries to fight it.</p>
