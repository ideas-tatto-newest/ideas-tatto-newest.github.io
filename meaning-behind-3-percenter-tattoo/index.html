<p>What is a three percenter? During the american revolution, the active forces in the field against the king�s tyranny never amounted to more than 3% of the colonists. The three percenters (aka 3%ers, iii%ers, or threepers) are a patriot movement paramilitary group that pledges armed resistance against attempts to restrict private gun ownership. New england patriots draft pick justin rohrwasser says he will permanently remove the controversial three percenters tattoo on his arm. The tattoo consists of the roman numeral iii surrounded by 13 stars representing the 13 original colonies.</p>
