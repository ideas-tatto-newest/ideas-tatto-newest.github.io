<p>I think it would be a great tattoo for anyone starting a new life after graduation, after a divorce, or after giving up an addiction. These tattoos can be achieved in single or multiple stars along with a long fading line. Prison tattooing is the practice of getting inked while behind bars. The thief�s star or thieve�s star is worn by russian gang members, criminals, and prisoners. Specifically among those imprisoned under the gulag system of the soviet era, the tattoos served to differentiate a criminal leader or thief in law from a political prisoner.</p>

<p>The nautical star tattoo with six points gets its origin from religious beliefs, and the star is supposed to be a representation of the star of david. These tattoos are done voluntarily, meaning the individual has to agree to receive the tattoo. Star tattoo meaning a star tattoo is a broad symbol that can range from simple to complex, a field of stars covering a large space or a single star placed on the wrist and hold countless meanings. Besides the moon, the star can also come with the sun and the planets, especially if the wearer loves astronomy. 6 another common presence of the five sided star is in show business (apparently there�s no business like it).</p>

<p>A nautical star tattoo can mean staying on course, finding your way, and an eternal connection to something or someone that you find ‘guides’ you through life. Only gang members are permitted to wear the group�s tattoo. It looks forward to the future and brings peace of mind. These tattoos are done voluntarily, meaning the individual has to agree to receive the tattoo. A pentagram with one point facing upwards, especially when surrounded by a circle, is a popular symbol among pagan faiths representing earth, air, fire, water and spirit.</p>
