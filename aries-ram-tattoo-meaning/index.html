<p>The ram is the symbol of aries. Aries is the first sign that appears in the sky at the beginning of the new year. And as a sheep symbolizes the beginning of the year, the warming, spring. The march equinox (spring in the northern hemisphere), is the start of the new zodiacal year and aries, the first sign, is associated with fresh vigour and unruly beginnings. The ram tattoo can be portrayed a number of ways, calm, fighting, or nonchalant.</p>
