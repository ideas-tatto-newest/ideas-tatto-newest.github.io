Tree tattoo with half and full moon with dogwood at the bottom on the forearm. Sketched across the back this monochromatic tattoo features a tree with the names of various members of the family. Palm tree tattoos work beautifully alongside flower tattoos, and are a favorite for women, in particular. Some people also like to turn a tattoo of one tree into a tattoo of many trees, sometimes adding in lakes, birds, and animals to make it a full scene of nature.</p>
