<p>It is very important to follow those instructions in order to achieve the best possible results from your permanent makeup procedure. Her eyebrows look totally natural, so we wonder if she has had microblading hair stroke tattooing. Do not use petroleum jelly (like vaseline) as this causes the brow to sweat underneath. Keep the area clean for the first day dabbing your brows with a cotton pad and sterile or bottled water. Aftercare is a very important part of every permanent makeup treatment.</p>
