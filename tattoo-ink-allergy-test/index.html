<p>Carbon sensitivities are quite rare and many people with known ink allergies can safely get all black tattoos. Black ink is typically made from carbon. Red tattoo pigments cause the most reactions, particularly those made from mercury sulfide (cinnabar). A few tattoo artists even offer to do a test to see if you are allergic. The tattoo area must be moisturized more than once daily.</p>

<p>Intense inflammatory reaction to the tattoo�s red ink. There are a variety of heavy metals that are often used as pigments that a small portion of people are allergic to. Hypersensitivity reactions to pigments used to make black, blue, purple and green tattoos are much less common. Symptoms of an allergic reaction to tattoo ink range from swelling, redness, rash, and more. Intenze ink uses a formula that eliminates known hazardous ingredients that are commonly found in other inks, but because we can’t test on everyone’s skin (only our own), there will always be a risk.</p>
